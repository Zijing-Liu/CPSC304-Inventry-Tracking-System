# Inventry Tracking System

The objective of this project is to create an inventory tracking system that will enable a business to monitor the state of each package and the quantity of goods on hand. Users will be able to examine package contents, present location, and transit status through the company's internal distribution network using the system.

Data on goods can be managed and viewed with ease thanks to the system's user interface. With the help of the interface, users will be able to look for particular goods or packages, update information about each package, see how many of each item are currently on hand, and monitor the progress of packages as they travel through the supply chain.

Real-time updates on package and inventory progress will also be provided by the system. Users will thus have access to the most recent data regarding the location and status of packages, the number of items in stock, and other relevant information. 

Overall, this inventory monitoring system will give a strong tool for managing inventory and following packages through the internal distribution network.
